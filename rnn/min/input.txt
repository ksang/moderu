Faintly,
I'll go
to take this
head on
Soon I'll come around
Lost and never found
Waiting for my words
seen but never heard
Buried underground,
but I'll keep coming!

Wipe those
tears off
heart proud
Make your
Soon I'll come around
Lost and never found
Waiting for my words
seen but never heard
Buried underground,
but I'll keep coming!

I'll keep coming!
